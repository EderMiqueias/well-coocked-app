# Specification Quality Checklist: Well Cooked UI/UX Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Assumptions section acknowledges styled-components v5 as the existing styling mechanism — this is a stack constraint reference, not a requirements leak. Acceptable.
- "Tutorial" and "Sobre" screen internals are explicitly out of scope; only menu-level visual changes are in scope.
- Mobile viewport is assumed out of scope for v1 per Assumptions; the 1280×720 gameplay fit (SC-005) targets desktop.
